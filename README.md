# Lunar Lander Environment
Implement a Deep Q Learning Network to successfully land a Lunar Lander in the Landing Zone.

## Project Idea
* Use the Lunar Lander Environment hosted by OpenAI Gym.
* Implement a Deep Q Learning Network to land the lunar lander successfully in the Landing Zone.

# Observations
We succesfully implemented the network and the Lunar Lander succesfully lands without crashing. Videos of the succesful landing can be found in the `videos/` directory
